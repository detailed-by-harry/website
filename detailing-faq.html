                            Detailing is more than just washing your vehicle. It involves cleaning, correcting and protecting 
                            your vehicle. Detailing requires a deep clean of both the interior and exterior of the vehicle to 
                            restore it back to its factory finish (or as close as possible). While you can complete some 
                            elements of detailing yourself, it is advised you see a professional to have it done properly.

                <p>There are four main steps to extrior detailing - Wash, Decontanimate, Correct and Protect. We have broken down 
                    each step into stages below. </p>

                        </button>
                        </h2>
                        <div id="collapseOne" class="accordion-collapse collapse show" aria-labelledby="headingOne" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">

                                <p>
                                    <strong>Wheel Cleaning - </strong>We use a non-acidic wheel cleaner or acid free wheel cleaning gel which is 
                                    sprayed onto the wheels and left to soak. Following the soaking period, we will use a wheel cleaning brush
                                    to help loosen any ingrained grime and dirt. Once complete, we will then pressure wash the cleaner and dirt 
                                    from the wheel.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Citrus Wash - </strong>This is a safe but effective product that is used to break down dirst, 
                                    traffic film and bugs. Simply spray on and use a soft exterior detailing brush to help remove any tough 
                                    dirt and get into those intricate areas. We will then rinse off and clean.
                                    Engine bays can also be cleaned using Citrus Wash, and it can be sprayed, 
                                    allowed to dwell, agitated and then wiped or gently rinsed - being extremely careful not to get water 
                                    in contact with electrical components under the bonnet.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Snow Foam - </strong>It is important to use snow foam before touching the car, 
                                    as this will ensure that any loose and potentially scratch-causing dirt is removed from the
                                    surface. Using a snow foam lance we apply the foam liberally over the car, allow to dwell and
                                    rinse off.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Shampoo - </strong>We use a high quality shampoo with a wash mitt and two buckets with grit guards
                                    to ensure the first contact stage of a wash is as gentle as possible. Using a sponge and one bucket will cause
                                     scratches, whereas a wash mitt does not retain surface dirt, and only clean shampoo solution is used on the 
                                     paintwork. We use one bucket with the shampoo solution (wash), and one bucket with clean water (rinse) - dip 
                                     the wash mitt into the wash bucket, apply to the vehicle, and then rinse the contaminants from the wash mitt 
                                     in the rinse bucket, repeat (starting at the top of the car and working to the bottom) until the car is
                                     cleaned, and then rinse.

                                    <strong>Iron Fall Out Removal - </strong>This is a very important part of the process, as brake dust
                                    and other iron contamination can embed itself into the surface of the paintwork and
                                    wheels. Using an iron fallout remover such as X-Tract, spray on, allow to dwell and
                                    then rinse off after the reaction (the red visual colour change) has taken place. Iron
                                    fall out removers can be used on paintwork as well as wheels.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Tar and Glue Removal - </strong>Ensure that all tar (potentially from road-resurfacing or a
                                    warm summer) and glue (from signwriting or stickers) is removed from the surface
                                    using a dedicated tar and glue remover. Although our Target is easy to rinse off due
                                    to the emulsifiers in the product, we would still recommend cleaning the areas where
                                    it has been used with a detergent before the next stage.
                                </p>

                                    <strong>Clay Mitt / Bar / Pad </strong>This will remove any ingrained dirt or contamination which
                                    the previous steps didn’t remove - you can use a shampoo solution or quick detailer
                                    as a clay lube to ensure that the mitt or bar move smoothly over the surface,
                                    alternatively we offer dedicated Clay Lubes under bespoke manufacturing.

                                    Re-wash the car with snow foam and shampoo after the decontamination stage, and
                                    ensure it is dry before continuing.

                                    Depending on the level of detail that is being done, corrections can be done with a
                                    simple hand applied car polish or a more aggressive and permanent machine
                                    applied cutting compound.

                                    <strong>Quick Correction - </strong>A hand-applied polish can be used for quick correction and can
                                    be done with a simple PDI, All in One or Cut and Shine polish, depending on the
                                    condition of the paintwork. Note, these types of hand applied polishes use fillers and
                                    mask scratches and swirls rather than permanently correcting them.
                                </p>

                                    <strong>Permanent Correction - </strong>This is aimed for a professional detailer, or experienced
                                    enthusiast, who understand the condition and thickness of the paint and how
                                    aggressive the compound being used should be. For permanent multi-stage
                                    correction, a rotary or dual action machine polisher should be used, along with
                                    suitable pads and cutting compounds.
                                </p>

                                    If using permanent correction products such as cutting compounds, we would
                                    recommend using panel wipe sprays and cleaning the surface thoroughly, otherwise,
                                    the protection is applied at the next stage may not bond to the surface adequately
                                    due to carrier oils and other potentially interfering substances in the polishing

                                    The type of protection that can be applied to the exterior of a vehicle can vary
                                    depending on the level of detail being undertaken and the experience of the detailer.

                                    <strong>Enthusiast Paint Protection - </strong>Car waxes (paintwork and wheel) and easy to use
                                    sealants can be used, as they are forgiving if applied wrong. These are
                                    recommended for detailers who are not experienced with high end sealants or
                                    coatings or do not have a controlled environment to apply a higher level coating
                                    (such as a temperature and moisture controlled facility). These product types will
                                    usually last between 3-12 months, depending on the price point and requirements.
                                </p>

                                    <strong>Professional Paint Protection - </strong>Professional paint protection usually uses Ceramic 
                                    Coatings for an enhanced level of protection. These are only recommended
                                    for experienced and trained users and if applied incorrectly can result in a full 
                                    machine polish of the car being required. However, when applied correctly, durability
                                    is excellent, offering high levels of protection for in excess of 2 years, and in some
                                    cases in excess of 5 years. Ceramic coatings offer self-cleaning/easy-clean
                                    properties and high levels of gloss.
                                </p>

                                    <strong>Glass Cleaners and Sealants - </strong>Before sealants are applied, a high-quality glass
                                    cleaner should be used to remove all contaminants (glass polish may be required for
                                    stubborn residues). Enthusiast or professional grades of glass sealants are available
                                    and should be applied after an IPA wipe down of the glass. Choose from our Glass
                                    Coat with up to 6 months’ worth of durability, or dedicated ceramic glass coatings.

                                    <strong>Trims and Dressings - </strong>For the perfect finish, trim and tyre gels and plastic dressings
                                    are required to give a “back to black” look - solvent-based dressings are typically
                                    more durable for exterior surfaces. Plastic dressings and sealants can also be under
                                    in the engine bay to allow easier cleaning further down the line.
                                </p>

                                    <strong>Quick Detailers - </strong>For any light dust or residues that have been missed from
                                    previous stages, a quick detailer can be used - simply spray on and then wipe off all
                                    surfaces to leave a perfect finish.

                <p>Detailing the interior of a vehicle is very dependent on the surfaces present -
                    whether it be fabric, leather, suede or Alcantara. It is important to clean and protect
                    the interior in case of spillages and for ease of future cleaning. </p>

                                    a dashboard renovator such as Quickshine is the safer and gentler option.

                                    <strong>Leather - </strong>Depending on the desired result and age of leather (if it is coated or
                                    synthetic leather or real), leather can be conditioned or sealed. Our leather
                                    conditioner offers a wax enriched protective finish which ensures easier cleaning and
                                    leaves a nice sheen finish. Our leather sealant gives an invisible finish, which offers
                                    durable protection against staining and general dirt and grime. We also offer a two in

                                    desired finish, especially on older cars. Sealants will give extended UV protection to
